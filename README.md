# SFR-Lisp

A very simple lisp-1. This is not designed to be
used for anything important, it is merely a self-learning exercise.

> What I cannot create in C, I do not understand.

## The Plan

- Make C at least as usable as Ruby
  - Symbol -- Just like Ruby Symbols
    - del
    - clone
  - String -- Mutable Strings
    - del
    - clone
  - Number -- Generic Numbers
    - del
    - clone
  - Hash   -- Just like Ruby Hash
  - Object
  - List   -- List of objects.
  - Shared Ptr Garbage Collection
